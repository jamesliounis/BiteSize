-----------------------


This repository is structured to seamlessly *build*, *deploy*, and *optimize* machine learning models for generating questions from documents. We have structured it in a way that follows the process that we followed ourselves. The easiest way to carry out the process from building and deploying the model to deploying a fully functional app would be to follow these simple steps:


1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed:
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Clone the repository (you may want to do this in a virtual environment):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jamesliounis/BiteSize.git
cd BiteSize
```

3. Run the Docker compose command that will initiate a multi-stage process involving building and running several Docker containers, each designed for a specific task in the workflow. The `--build` flag ensures that Docker images for each service are built (or rebuilt) before starting the containers. 

```bash
# Build and run containers with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

Faster and more efficient methods for extracting important knowledge are crucial for the modern student and educator. By automating question generation from course materials, students using the *BiteSize* application save time and learn faster and more effectively. 

We recognize every student is different. Thus, we've built *BiteSize* to create tests of your customization of difficulty, repeats, and test length. We also recognize the way information is presented across courses differs. *BiteSize* can test you on the textual information of your handouts (pdfs, docxs, and other formats) as well as uploaded graphs / figures. 

*BiteSize* can aid educators in quickly preparing assessment materials and students in better understanding their materials in an interactive manner.

### Example Uses

![Pitch](./reports/bitesize_overview_arch.png)

Here is a quick overview of our application: our app is divided into three tabs: "Home", "About Us", and "Start Learning". The "Home" tab is the main landing page, providing an overview of our platform. The "About Us" tab offers information about our team. Lastly, the "Start Learning" tab is where users can begin their educational journey on our platform. 


#### Home
![Home](./reports/home.png)
The landing page showcases the app's presentation, and at the bottom, there's a button that redirects users to the "Start Learning" page. This design encourages users to explore and initiate their learning experience with a simple click.

#### About us
![About us](./reports/about.png)
Includes pictures, names, and email addresses of the team members, giving users a glimpse into the developers of the app.

#### Start Learning
![Start learning](./reports/learn.png)

This main tab is where users interact with the app, and they need to:

1. Select the test type; the app currently offers the option of multiple choice.

2. Upload a document. Users can upload a PDF or Word document to be tested. By clicking the upload button, selecting their local file, users can visualize the document and proceed with the testing.

3. The test will be generated, and users can start by selecting the correct answers. At the end, users will receive feedback with the correct options and a score.


##### Multiple Choice
![Multiple Choice](./reports/mcq.png)

In the continued section of the Start Learning tab, when the user chooses the Multiple Choice option, the prompt or question appears as the title, accompanied by four answer choices. Only one of these choices is correct, and the user must select the corresponding radio button to indicate their answer. Once the user has made their selection, they can proceed by clicking the submit button.


<!--
##### Short Answer
![Short Answer](./reports/short.png)

In the continuation of the Short Answer tab, similar to the multiple-choice questionnaire, when the user selects the Short Answer option, the prompt or question is displayed as the title. Below, there is an input box where the user can type a short answer. Once the user has provided their response, they can proceed by selecting the submit button to submit their answer.
-->


##### Feedback
![Feedback](./reports/feedback.png)
After clicking the submit button on either the Multiple Choice (MCQ) or Short Answer test, the user will receive feedback indicating whether their option/answer was correct or not. Additionally, the user will see specific feedback generated by the Language Learning Model (LLM) in response to their input. This feedback serves as an informative output, helping users understand the correctness of their response and providing insights for learning. If the answer is correct, it will be displayed in green, if it is wrong, the feedback will be displayed in red. At the bottom of the page, the user can the grade which represents the percentage of questions correctly answered.

# Code Structure
The following are the folders from the previous milestones:

```bash
- build_backend
- deploy_frontend
- deploy_interactive_app
- frontend
- intermediary
- preprocessing_question_gen
```
<!-- # OpenLLaMA-7b for Textual Test Generation 
Please refer to the diagram below for an overview of our current infrastructure. 

![Architecture Diagram](./reports/architecture_diagram_v2.png)

The `models` directory is dedicated to all operations concerning the model. You can execute all the workflow steps of this part by simply running:

```bash
cd ./models/deploy/deploy_model/
./run_all.sh
``` -->
## Build Backend (src/build_backend)

You can deploy the backend with one simple command as a shell file encapsulates all the steps necessary, from building the application containers to deploying the entire backend via an Ansible playbook. Simply run the following command:

```bash
cd deploy/
sh deploy_to_k8s.sh
```
This script will set up roles and permissions (all the permissions are being given via individual shell scripts in the `roles_and_permissions` directory, see next section), and deploy your application using the `deploy_to_k8s.yml` file.

The entire application is deployed to this Kubernetes cluster:

![Kubernetes Cluster](./reports/kubernetes_cluster.png)

<!-- 
JAMES ADD HERE -->

This Kubernetes cluster encompasses all of the relevant components of BiteSize's back-end. These are mainly wrapped into 2 main containers: `bitesize-question-gen`, which handles extracting the text from the documents and generating the questions, and `grade-and-explain`. 

### `bitesize-question-gen`

![Question-Generating Container](./reports/bitesize-question-gen.png)

The process can be summarized as follows:
1. The user uploads a document which is sent to a GCS bucket.
2. The front-end enacts a process during which the user-choice and the document text (extracted via `GET` request from the `/extract-text` method) are sent via `POST` request to the `/generate-questions` method in the application script.
3. This triggers the inference process where a `POST` request with the prompt, user choice, and text are sent to the deployed model endpoint on Vertex AI.
4. The inference is handled by the application script and displayed on the front-end to collect user input (i.e., answers to the questions).
5. Once user input is collected, question and user answers are written in an appropriately-formatted JSON object to the GCS bucket for subsequent grading. 

### `grade-and-explain`

![Grading Container](./reports/grade-and-explain.png)

The process can be summarized as follows:

1. A grading request is sent by the front-end which is handled by the `/generate-explanations` method in the application script.
2. The document and the previously-collected user answers are packaged into a `POST` request that is sent to the deployed model endpoint with a prompt to generate explanations. Grading is handled separately via a regular expression-based application directly in the script (no generative AI).
3. Inference is collected and handled by application script and formatted appropriately in accordance to what is needed by the front-end.
4. Grade and explanations are shown in the front-end.
   
## Frontend (src/frontend)

This container contains all the files to develop and build a react app. There are dockerfiles for both development and production

To run the container locally:

- Open a terminal and go to the location where awesome-app/src/frontend
- Run `bash runall.sh`
- Go to http://localhost:8000 to access the app locally

<!-- We used React and React-Bootstrap for our website. These are two libraries that work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to help maintain common elements across website pages and provide pre-made elements like buttons and fill-in forms. Using a flow-chart approach, the main page establishes the website's theme, presenting the brand palette and logos. Users can learn more about developers or start learning.

The upload page, allows users to input the number of questions, select a test type, and upload a document. The uploaded document is previewed below, with a "Start Test" button appearing upon successful upload. After clicking, a processing spinner appears.

Upon completion, users enter a test environment with a card-like container for questions. They answer using radio buttons or a text box, clicking "Submit" to move to the next question. This repeats until all questions are answered, leading to the final page that provides feedback on each question and calculates the score. -->


### Deploy Frontend 

This how we built in the local directory structure in cloud shell so that it can be registered to Artifact Registry, and then deployed to GKE.

To deploy: (Reference - https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app)

- Run the following from the GCP Cloud Shell (see reference for how to open it):

    ``` 
    export PROJECT_ID=ac215-bitesize-406717
    export REGION=us
    export REPO=bitesize-application-repo
    export COMPUTE_REGION=us-east1
    export CLUSTER=bitesize-cluster
    ````
- Create a repository
    -   Set your project ID for the Google Cloud CLI
`gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID`

    - Create repo in artifacts registry
        ``````
        gcloud artifacts repositories create ${REPO} \
        --repository-format=docker \
        --location=${REGION} \
        --description="Bitesize front-end and HTTP endpoints"
        ``````

- Build the container image
    - Get application files in place, ideally via `git clone...` 
    <!-- - At the top of the command line interface, there are some options including "Open Editor", a keyboard icon, a gear icon, etc.
    - To the right of these icons is the 3-button menu (⋮), click on that -> Upload -> Folder ... -->

    - cd into the root directory of the repo
`cd AC215_BiteSize`

    - Build and tag the Docker images for each distinct Dockerized service (one per dockerfile):
    
    
        ``` 
        docker build -t ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app-backend:latest src/intermediary/.
        docker build -t ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app:latest src/frontend/. 
        ```

    - Note: you can see the images just created with
`docker container images`

    - Add IAM policy bindings to your service account:
   
        ``````
        gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding bitesize-application-repo \
            --location=${REGION} \
            --member=serviceAccount:backend@ac215-bitesize-406717.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
            --role="roles/artifactregistry.reader"
        ``````
    


- (Optionally) test the services to make sure they build locally:

    ```
    docker run --rm -p  8080:8080 ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app-backend:latest
    docker run --rm -p  8000:3000 ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app:latest
    ```

- Push the Docker image to Artifact Registry
-  Configure the Docker command-line tool to authenticate to Artifact Registry:

    ``
    gcloud auth configure-docker us-docker.pkg.dev
    ``
- Push the Docker image that you just built to the repository:
    ``````
    docker push ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app-backend:latest
    docker push ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app:latest
    ``````

- Create a GKE cluster
    - Set your Compute Engine region:
    ``
gcloud config set compute/region ${COMPUTE_REGION}
    ``
-  Create a cluster:
    ``
    gcloud container clusters create-auto ${CLUSTER}
    ``

- Deploy application to GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
    - Ensure that you are connected to your GKE cluster.
        ``````
        gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER} --region ${COMPUTE_REGION}
        ``````
    - Create a Kubernetes Deployment for each Docker image:
        ``````
        kubectl create deployment bitesize-app-backend --image=${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app-backend:latest
        kubectl create deployment bitesize-app --image=${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPO}/bitesize-app:latest
        ```````
    - Set the baseline number of Deployment replicas to 1:
        ``````
        kubectl scale deployment bitesize-app-backend --replicas=1
        kubectl scale deployment bitesize-app --replicas=1
        ``````
    - Create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource for each Deployment.:
        ``````
        kubectl autoscale deployment bitesize-app-backend --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=5
        kubectl autoscale deployment bitesize-app --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=5
        ````````
    -(Optional) validate the pods this created by looking at them : `kubectl get pods`


- Exposing the services to the internet
    <!-- - Note: not sure if this is necessary for the backend as the frontend queries it via localhost: -->
    ``````
    kubectl expose deployment bitesize-app-backend --name=bitesize-app-backend-service --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
    kubectl expose deployment bitesize-app --name=bitesize-app-service --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 3000
    ``````
- Check the newly-generated external IPs with the following command: `kubectl get service`

## Intermediary (src/intermediary)
This  is the second backend that send the files to the GCP bucket and then sends the file to the deployed model. 


## CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

Finally, we added CI/CD using GitHub Actions, enabling us to trigger deployment or any other pipeline seamlessly with GitHub Events. Our YAML files are located under .github/workflows. The YAML file containing the routine is named ci-cd.yml.

We implemented a CI/CD workflow to leverage the deployment container for streamlining the deployment process of our application. This occurs whenever changes are made in the code, such as for a new version of the app or API. The deployment container is configured to manage various tasks, including building, packaging, and deploying different components of our application stack, including both the backend and the frontend.

This automated workflow ensures the seamless integration of changes pushed to the 'milestone6' branch. The process is automatically triggered whenever a commit message includes '/run-deploy-app', providing an efficient way to manage our CI/CD pipeline. This setup allows us to maintain a robust and reliable deployment process for our project on GitHub.

-->

<!-- ## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the backend app directory:

```bash
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [CLONED_DIRECTORY]/src/build_backend

```bash
cd src/build_backend
ls
```

## Directory Structure

- `deploy/`: Scripts and Kubernetes configurations for deployment.
- `generate_test/`: Scripts for generating tests from documents.
- `grade_and_explain/`: Scripts for automatic grading and providing explanations.
- `post_requests/`: Scripts for generating post requests to send to deployed model.

## Deploying backend

You can deploy the backend with one simple command as a shell file encapsulates all the steps necessary, from building the application containers to deploying the entire backend via an Ansible playbook. Simply run the following command:

```bash
cd deploy/
sh deploy_to_k8s.sh
```
This script will set up roles and permissions (all the permissions are being given via individual shell scripts in the `roles_and_permissions` directory, see next section), and deploy your application using the `deploy_to_k8s.yml` file.

The entire application is deployed to this Kubernetes cluster:

![Kubernetes Cluster](./reports/kubnernetes_cluster.png)

## Sending POST / GET requests to deployed services

Once the backend is deployed, the front-end may then interact with it via POST and GET requests. We have compiled scripts that achieve these either in a Python / JavaScript format, the latter of which we used for testing and the former of which we used to actually implement in our front-end. All these scripts can be found in our `post_requests` directory, in which we have separated them based on the task they acheive. 

```shell
cd ./src/build_backend/post_requests
```
To learn about how these requests operate, please refer to architecture diagrams of application backend. 


## Roles and Permissions

Kubernetes configurations for roles and permissions are defined in the roles_and_permissions/ directory. Apply them as necessary:

```shell
kubectl apply -f roles_and_permissions/deployment-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f roles_and_permissions/deployment-rolebinding.yaml
kubectl apply -f roles_and_permissions/pod-reader-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f roles_and_permissions/read-pods-binding.yaml
``` -->

**○ Data Scientists:** they play a pivotal role in our solution architecture by contributing to:

1. Creating code for text parsing and information cleaning: develop code to parse text from documents and ensure the extraction of clean and accurate information.

2. Selecting the best algorithm and model: They are responsible for choosing the most suitable algorithm and model though experimentation, enabling the app to efficiently analyze and extract relevant information from uploaded documents.

3. Applying techniques like prompt engineering: using techniques such as prompt engineering, they generate questions and feed the user's answers back into the model for feedback, overseeing the question-generation process.

4. Assessing and evaluating ML task results: Data scientists evaluate the quality of questions and answers generated by the model, ensuring optimal performance and relevance.

5. Optimizing the model: They employ methods like pruning and quantization to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the model.

6. Deploying the model: Data scientists oversee the deployment of the model, ensuring seamless integration into the app for end-users.


**○ Developers:** Developers are instrumental in constructing the app, ensuring the seamless integration of machine learning algorithms and user interfaces. Their multifaceted role encompasses:

1. Building the App: Developers are responsible for the overall development of the application.

2. Designing the Frontend and implementing It: They design and implement the frontend of the app, focusing on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

3. Integrating the Frontend with Backend: Developers integrate the frontend with the backend, ensuring smooth communication and functionality.

4. Coding, Testing, and Refining: Their ongoing tasks involve coding new features, rigorously testing the application, and refining it for optimal performance and an enhanced user experience.


**○ Users:** Users play a crucial role in the app, engaging in the following tasks:

<!-- ## Technical Architecture

![Technical Architecture](./reports/tech.png)



### Building the Frontend part of the Application

The frontend of the application is build using ReactJS. It is divided as follows: a components folder that contains the different components of the application, a css folder that contains the css files for the different components, and a pages folder that contains the different pages of the application. 

The components folder contains the following components: DataContext.js, MainContent.js, MCQuestion.js, Navigation.js, SAQuestion.js, TCard.js, and TestType.js. These are the components that are used to build the application and they are all imported in the App.js file.


### Building the Backend part of the Application 

This backend application takes a document as input, scrapes its text, and generates questions to quiz students. It includes components for deployment, test generation, grading, and explanation, and posting requests.

For the backend, we used a Flask application to expose Python functions to the frontend. This application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible. The backend is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the frontend and the machine learning model. It receives the document from the frontend, sends it to the model for processing, and returns the generated questions to the frontend. The backend also handles the user's responses to the questions, providing feedback based on the answers. The backend is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible, ensuring scalability and maintainability. 

The backend folder as a whole contains the following components: a Dockerfile that defines the environment for the backend, a requirements.txt file that contains the dependencies required for the backend, a deploy_container.sh script that deploys the backend container to Google Cloud Run, and a main.py script that contains the main application code. For that we use FastAPI to create the endpoint that would send the file from the front end into the GCP bucket. -->

<!-- 
## User interface
The frontend of our application uses React, Node.js, and CSS. React is a handy tool for building dynamic interfaces. It helps organize the code with reusable components, making it easier to manage. Node.js supports the backend, handling server-side tasks and finally, CSS takes care of styling and layout, ensuring a good-looking and responsive design. Together, they make our web app interactive, user-friendly, and efficient.

Our frontend is divided into three tabs: "Home", "About Us", and "Start Learning". The "Home" tab is the main landing page, providing an overview of our platform. The "About Us" tab offers information about our team. Lastly, the "Start Learning" tab is where users can begin their educational journey on our platform. 


#### Home
![Home](./reports/home.png)
The landing page showcases the app's presentation, and at the bottom, there's a button that redirects users to the "Start Learning" page. This design encourages users to explore and initiate their learning experience with a simple click.

#### About us
![About us](./reports/about.png)
Includes pictures, names, and email addresses of the team members, giving users a glimpse into the developers of the app.

#### Start Learning
![Start learning](./reports/learn.png)

This main tab is where users interact with the app, and they need to:

1. Choose the number of questions by either manually inputting the value or using the arrows in the quantity box. The app ensures the number is greater than 0; otherwise, a red warning message is displayed.

2. Select the test type; the app currently offers two options: multiple choice or short answer. Users can pick the type that suits their preferences.

3. Upload a document. Users can upload a PDF or Word document to be tested. By clicking the upload button, selecting their local file, users can visualize the document and proceed with the testing.


##### Multiple Choice
![Multiple Choice](./reports/mcq.png)

In the continued section of the Start Learning tab, when the user chooses the Multiple Choice option, the prompt or question appears as the title, accompanied by four answer choices. Only one of these choices is correct, and the user must select the corresponding radio button to indicate their answer. Once the user has made their selection, they can proceed by clicking the submit button.

##### Short Answer
![Short Answer](./reports/short.png)

In the continuation of the Short Answer tab, similar to the multiple-choice questionnaire, when the user selects the Short Answer option, the prompt or question is displayed as the title. Below, there is an input box where the user can type a short answer. Once the user has provided their response, they can proceed by selecting the submit button to submit their answer.

##### Feedback
![Feedback](./reports/feedback.png)
After clicking the submit button on either the Multiple Choice (MCQ) or Short Answer test, the user will receive feedback indicating whether their option/answer was correct or not. Additionally, the user will see specific feedback generated by the Language Learning Model (LLM) in response to their input. This feedback serves as an informative output, helping users understand the correctness of their response and providing insights for learning. If the answer is correct, it will be displayed in green, if it is wrong, the feedback will be displayed in red. At the bottom of the page, the user can the grade which represents the percentage of questions correctly answered. -->

## ViLT-32b for Visual Question Answering Test Generation
Please refer to the diagram below for an overview of our proposed infrastructure. 

![VQA Architcture](./reports/vqa_architecture.png)

### **Step 1: Data loading and fine-tuning**
For our model, we wanted to generate questions based on images, and we explored the use of the [ViLT-32b] model from Hugging Face. 

We fine tuned our model. To achieve so, we first needed to load the data. We used the [VQA dataset](https://visualqa.org/download.html) for this purpose. The dataset is available in two formats: `mscoco` and `abstract_v002`. We chose to use the `mscoco` format as it is more widely used and has more data.

Once we obtained the data, we put it on a GCP bucket. From there, we were able to traine the model as you can see in the file src/vqa/training branch.
Some of the files in this branch are:
- `task.py`: This file contains the code to train the model. It also contains the code to load the data from the GCP bucket and the model.
- `cli.sh`: This file is used to run the `train.py` file on a GCP VM. It also contains the parameters that we used to train the model.
- `dockerfile`: This file is used to create a docker image that contains all the dependencies needed to train the model.

Due to quota constraints, we decide it to run it for 10 epochs. 

Here it is the graph of the loss  as given by WandB:

![Training](./reports/finetune.jpeg)

### **Step 2: Model Deployment**
To being able to infer, we first needed to upload the weights into a bucket. The code for that is on the folder `src/vqa/deployment`.

Some of the most important files from there are:
- `cli.py` : this file is where we retrieve the model weight after training.
- `docker-shell.sh`: this file is used to create a docker image that contains all the dependencies needed to obtain the weights.

The model is available in the GCP bucket `gs://vqa-app-models-demo`.


### **Decision on incorporating the feature into the deployed app**

#### **Introduction**
After conducting trials in inference and experimenting with fine-tuning a VQA (Visual Question Answering) model, we ultimately decided against incorporating this feature into the deployed app. The initial goal of the exploration process was to generate questions based on the textual interpretation of images, assuming that the multimodal model is robust enough to capture any detail or technical specificity in the image.

#### **Challenges and limitations**
The objective was to generate questions from images at a level that reinforces student learning. However, the challenge lies in the highly specialized nature of the required knowledge. For instance, in an art class, it might involve distinguishing between different styles, names of artworks and artists, or techniques used. In mathematics, the aim could be to recognize equations or mathematical properties. In zoology, the focus might be on identifying varieties or animal families. In medicine, the goal could be to recognize specific symptoms or conditions.

The outputs of the available multimodal models, even after fine-tuning, lack the necessary specialization. This outcome is somewhat expected, as achieving the ideal scenario of accurately answering any possible question on any uploaded image requires highly specialized knowledge. Such knowledge would necessitate extensive and specific datasets covering a wide array of topics and domain expertise, which is beyond the project's scope. Given that the app is designed to be multipurpose and not specialized in any particular subject, we made the decision to omit this feature. Instead, we opted to concentrate on optimizing and reallocating resources to work on the Textual Test Generation model. This focus will allow for more flexible test generation, evaluation, and providing feedback to students.

#### **Approaches**
##### **1. VQA**
We observed that the available VQA models on Hugging Face can answer basic questions but are limited to the vocabulary of the model. The vocabulary of VQA models lacks a sufficiently rich representation to answer the specialized questions we desire within our app. Architectures like [VILT-B32](https://huggingface.co/dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa) output a vector of probabilities for tokens (similar to a classification problem), and these tokens depend on the fixed vocabulary.

##### **2. Captioners**
Other explored ideas included using captioners like [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large) or [VIT-GPT2](https://huggingface.co/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning). However, the same issue arises: the descriptions are relatively short, and the vocabulary is not specialized enough to construct a useful question from the text.

##### **3. Specialized computer vision services**
Additionally, there are other specialized computer vision services, such as [Astica AI](https://astica.ai/vision/describe-images/), that offer an API that provides a caption, tags, and a long description. However, they also face the challenge of a vocabulary that is not specialized enough for our specific needs.

##### **4. Fine-tuning a extremelly specific domain**
Finally, we also explored the possibility of fine-tuning a captioning model for a specialized topic, such as [medical evaluation of chest X-rays](https://towardsdatascience.com/medical-image-captioning-on-chest-x-rays-a43561a6871d). However, even with specific data, the model's performance fell short of our expectations. This raised concerns, as scaling up this focus tp more topics seemed unviable. If deployed, the app might provide erroneous information on sensitive and complex topics like the medical field, which is inherently intricate. Consequently, this approach did not convince us. Additionally, it presented a significant limitation as it restricted usage to an extremely specific area (disease detection using chest X-rays), which would only work if the user submits pictures of chest X-rays for inference. This restriction meant it could only answer questions related to this specific domain. Such a narrow focus contradicted the multipurpose nature we envisioned for the app.

## Custom Objects

### `MCQGenerator`
> Note: Located in `generate_mcq.py`

This is the interface for users which...

1. Processes the textual information into something our model can use to create custom tests
2. Create a `TestBank`, which holds all the possible questions provided from the inference call to our hosted mode on Vertex AI
3. Format the individual tests returned by `TestBank`

### `TestBank`

This object allows us to anchor a text to a TestBank object, which can store multiple question banks of Multiple-Choice Questions, Short Answers, Mixed Formats, and Custom Prompts. It contains it's own instantiation of the `LLamaTextGenerator`, for which we use specific functions pre-loaded with prompts to generate the entire question bank for our 4 outlined options. 

Short documents inherently generate fewer questions to maintains quality of the questions. 

The question bank is generated all at once for every textual document upload and contains questions of 3-tiered difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Difficult. These are saved to the particular instatiation of the `TestBank` object. This strategy ensures we inference the deployed model only once, thus optimizing the actual test generation to be a standard retrieval from storage. 

#### Explicitly Handled Special Cases

| _Situation_ | _Behavior_ |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| User wants a test of unseen question but has gone through them all | (1) Inform them  (2) Reset the unseen question to entire question bank |
|  User wants unseen questions only but they want more questions than are available | (1) Inform them  (2) Make a shorter test including all the questions in the question bank by re-assigning number of questions argument|
| User asked for more questions than they have left in the unseen set | (1) Inform them  (2) Make a test out of the remaining unseen questions by re-assigning number of questions argument|
|  User tries to enter something other than a single number for their number of questions argument | (1) Inform them through `TypeError` |

### `LlamaTextGenerator`
> Note: Located in `infer.py`

Connects to the Vertex AI deployment of our pruned and dynamically quantized verson of OpenLLaMA-7b. Also sends prediction requests based on the call to build the respective question bank from `TestBank` as indicated by the user interacting with the interface `MCQGenerator`.

### `Bucket`
> Note: Located in `gcp.py`

Rather than needing to call the client mutliple times to connect to our GCP bucket with documents, we can store the information and important methods for listing and getting files in this object.  Has the benefit of making our source code more self-documenting.

### Errors

#### `OverwriteError`
> Note: Located in `customerrors.py`

This is a custom `Exception` which is raised in the specific development case when the `QuestionGenerator` has text but our methods is trying to re-assign a document to an already instantaited object. 


#### `DocumentLength`
> Note: Located in `customerrors.py`

This is a custom `Exception` which is raised in the specific user case when the `TestBank` is asked to create a question bank from text that is too short to make a meaningful quiz from. 

#### `UnknownTestType`
> Note: Located in `customerrors.py`

This is a custom `Exception` which is raised in the specific developed case when the `MCQGenerator` that is fed something other than mcq, short answer, or custom when building a question bank.  -->
